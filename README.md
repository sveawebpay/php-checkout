## Introduction
The checkout offers a complete solution with a variety of payment methods. The payment methods that are currently available in the checkout are invoice, payment plan, account credit, card payments and payment by bank.


The checkout supports both B2C and B2B payments, fast customer identification and caches customers behaviour.


This library provides entrypoints to integrate the checkout into your platform and to administrate checkout orders.

### Test credentials

You can find credentials that can be used in the stage environment without signing an contract with Svea Ekonomi [here](https://www.svea.com/globalassets/sweden/foretag/betallosningar/e-handel/integrationspaket-logos-and-doc.-integration-test-instructions-webpay/test-instructions-payments-partners.pdf)

The example files also contain merchant credentials which can be used in the stage environment.

### 1. Setup

#### 1.1 Installing with [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/)

Execute the following line in your command line interface:
```bash
composer require sveaekonomi/checkout
```

or add the following to your composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "sveaekonomi/checkout": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
and run command ` composer update ` in your CLI

#### 1.2 Install without composer
You can also download the library and upload it onto your server.

### 2. General information

#### 2.1 Creating a Connector
You have to use a connector object as parameter when creating a CheckoutClient or a CheckoutAdminClient-object which is used to create API requests.

The connector defines what credentials should be used and which environment should be used.


Parameters for creating Connector are: checkoutMerchantId, checkoutSecret and base API url(environment).

```php
// include the library
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

// include library without composer, include.php is in the library root
require_once 'include.php';

$checkoutMerchantId = '100001';
$checkoutSecret = 'checkoutSecret';
//set endpoint url. Eg. test or prod
$baseUrl = \Svea\Checkout\Transport\Connector::TEST_BASE_URL;

$connector = \Svea\Checkout\Transport\Connector::init($checkoutMerchantId, $checkoutSecret, $baseUrl);
```
#### 2.2 CheckoutClient
The CheckoutClient class contains four methods which can be used to:
* [Create order](#3-create-order) - Creates a Svea Checkout order
* [Update order](#5-update-order) - Updates an existing Svea Checkout order
* [Get order](#4-get-order) - Gets order data from an existing order
* [Get payment plan campaigns](#71-getavailablepartpaymentcampaigns) - Fetches campaigns which can for example be used to display price per month on product page

To ensure that a snippet always is displayed to the end-user, we recommend using the following flow in your platform:

![Recommended flow of checkout](docs/image/flow.png?raw=true)

#### 2.3 CheckoutAdminClient
The CheckoutAdminClient class contains methods which are used to administrate orders which have been creating using the CheckoutClient class.

Orders can only be administrated if [CheckoutOrderStatus](#88-checkoutorderstatus) is "FINAL", any other status indicates that the order has not been finalized by the end-customer.

In order to perform an action on an order, the order needs to have an [action](#10148-order-actions). You'll have to get the order using ["Get Order"](#101-get-order) and check which [actions](#10148-order-actions) are available and then use a corresponding method.

For example, if you want to credit an order you first have to use [Get order](#101-get-order). Let's say that the action returned is "CanCreditAmount", then you'll have to use [Credit amount](#1010-credit-amount) to credit the order.

Some actions may not be available on certain order types, but a good integration doesn't check order type but rather which actions are available for use.

The available methods are:
* [Get order](#101-get-order) - Returns order data from Payment Admin, contains other information than the method in CheckoutClient
* [Get task](#102-get-task) - Returns the status of a previously performed operation
* [Deliver order](#103-deliver-order) - Creates a delivery on a checkout order(sends invoice to end-customer etc.)
* [Cancel order](#104-cancel-order) - Cancels an order
* [Cancel order amount](#105-cancel-order-amount) - Removes a specified amount from an order
* [Cancel order row](#106-cancel-order-row) - Removes order rows from an order
* [Credit order rows](#107-credit-order-rows) - Credits order rows on a delivered order
* [Credit new order row](#108-credit-new-order-row) - Creates a new order row with a credited amount
* [Credit order rows with fee](#109-credit-order-rows-with-fee) - Credits order rows on a delivered order and adds a fee
* [Credit amount](#1010-credit-amount) - Credits a specified amount
* [Add order row](#1011-add-order-row) - Adds an order row to the order
* [Update order row](#1012-update-order-row) - Updates an existing order row
* [Replace order rows](#1013-replace-order-rows) - Replaces all order rows on an order with new order rows


### 3. Create order
To create a new order, you'll need to instantiate an object of \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient and pass a [*Connector*](#2-create-a-connector) as an parameter.

You can then use the method "create" in the object, pass the data below into the method. See example below.

The response will contain all order data along with a snippet which contains the iframe which needs to be rendered to the end-user.

$response = $checkoutClient->create($data);
```

[See full example](https://github.com/sveawebpay/php-checkout/blob/master/examples/create-order.php)

### 4. Get Order
To fetch an existing order, you'll need to instantiate an object of \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient and pass a [*Connector*](#2-create-a-connector) as an parameter.

You can then use the method "get" in the object, pass the data below into the method. See example below.

The response contains the order information and the along with the GUI which can be used to render the iframe once again.

| Parameters IN                | Required  | Type      | Description  |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| orderId                           |	*      | Long      | Checkoutorderid of the specified order |

| Parameters OUT               | Type      | Description  |
|------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Data                         | Data      | An object containing all of the order-data, see structure [here](#6-response) |


```php
// include the library
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

// without composer
require_once 'include.php';

$data = array(
        'orderId' => 51721
    );

$checkoutClient = new \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient($connector);

$response = $checkoutClient->get($data);
```

[See full example](https://github.com/sveawebpay/php-checkout/blob/master/examples/get-order.php)



### 5. Update Order
To update an existing order, you'll need to instantiate an object of \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient and pass a [*Connector*](#2-create-a-connector) as an parameter.

The method returns the order information and the updated Gui needed to display the iframe for Svea Checkout. The previously displayed iframe should be replaced by the iframe in the response received when updating the order unless using the Javascript API.

Updating an order is only possible while the CheckoutOrderStatus is "Created", see [*CheckoutOrderStatus*](#78-checkoutorderstatus).

This method can be combined with the Javascript API, if the iframe is disabled using the JS API and the order is updated while the it's disabled the iframe will be updated once it's enabled again. This removes the requirement of replacing the iframe once the order is updated.

| Parameters IN:     | Required   | Type      | Description  |
|-------------------------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| OrderId                       |	*        | Long      | Checkoutorderid of the specified order.
| Cart                          |	 *       | Cart      | A cart-object containing the [*OrderRows*](#73-orderrow) |
| MerchantData                  |            | String    | Can be used to store data, the data is not displayed anywhere but in the API |

```php
// include the library
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

// without composer
require_once 'include.php';

...

$checkoutClient = new \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient($connector);

$data = array(
        "orderId" => 251147,
        "merchantData" => "test",
        "cart" => array(
            "items" => array(
                array(
                    "articleNumber" => "123456",
                    "name" => "Yellow rubber duck",
                    "quantity" => 200,
                    "unitPrice" => 66600,
                    "discountPercent" => 1000,
                    "vatPercent" => 2500,
                    "temporaryReference" => "230",
                    "merchantData" => "Size: M"
                ),
                array(
                    "articleNumber" => "658475",
                    "name" => "Shipping Fee Updated",
                    "quantity" => 100,
                    "unitPrice" => 4900,
                    "vatPercent" => 2500,
                    "temporaryReference" => "231",
                    "merchantData" => null
                )
            )
        )
    );

$response = $checkoutClient->update($data);

### 7. Additional requests

#### 7.1 GetAvailablePartPaymentCampaigns

GetAvailablePartPaymentCampaigns can be used to fetch the details of all the campaigns that are available on the merchant

The information can be used to for example display information about how much it will cost to pay for a certain product or products on the actual product page.

[See example](https://github.com/sveawebpay/php-checkout/blob/master/examples/get-available-part-payment-campaigns.php)


Example Request:
```php

$checkoutMerchantId = 100002;
$checkoutSecret = "3862e010913d7c44f104ddb4b2881f810b50d5385244571c3327802e241140cc692522c04aa21c942793c8a69a8e55ca7b6131d9ac2a2ae2f4f7c52634fe30d2";
$baseUrl = \Svea\Checkout\Transport\Connector::TEST_BASE_URL;

$conn = \Svea\Checkout\Transport\Connector::init($checkoutMerchantId, $checkoutSecret, $baseUrl);
$checkoutClient = new \Svea\Checkout\CheckoutClient($conn);

$data = array(
    'IsCompany' => false
);
$response = $checkoutClient->getAvailablePartPaymentCampaigns($data);
echo "<pre>" . print_r($response, true) . "</pre>";
```

Executing the code above will return an array with [8.11 CampaignCodeInfo](#811-campaigncodeinfo)

Example response:
```php
Array

    [0] => Array
        (

                    [ToAmount] => 30000
        )
)
```

The information should be stored in a database for fast access instead of sending requests on demand.

##### Calculation formulas

Calculating price per month:
```php
(InitialFee + (ceil(ProductPrice * MonthlyAnnuityFactor) + NotificationFee) * ContractLengthInMonths) / ContractLengthInMonths
```

Using the second campaign with a product price of 1500kr in the example above will result in:
(0 + (ceil(1500 * 0.092586652785396) + 29 ) * 12) / 12 = (0 + (139 + 29) * 12 ) / 12 = 168kr



Calculating total amount to pay:
```php
InitialFee + (ProductPrice * MonthlyAnnuityFactor + NotificationFee) * ContractLengthInMonths
```

Using the second campaign with a product price of 150kr in the example above will result in:
0 + (150 * 0.092586652785396 + 29 ) * 12 = 514.655975 round upwards to closest whole number -> 515kr

### !!! NOTE !!!

## 11. Javascript API

(Please note that the API is still considered a work in progress and might see significant changes.)

### API entry point

window.scoApi is the root object for the API and contains all the operations available.

### Listening for API readiness

The checkout raises an event when ready, which can be used to safely access the API.

*Example:*
```javascript
document.addEventListener("checkoutReady", function() {
    window.scoApi... // Your code here
});
```

### Available operations

#### observeEvent(propertyString, handlerFunction) => function

Observes the client data for changes, calling the supplied function when a change is detected.

Returns a function that can be called to stop observing the specified property.

The following properties are currently supported:

```javascript
"identity.isCompany"
"identity.email"
"identity.phoneNumber"
"identity.companyName"
"identity.firstName"
"identity.lastName"
"identity.streetAddress"
"identity.coAddress"
"identity.postalCode"
"identity.city"
"identity.addressLines"
```

*Example:*
```javascript
// Observe the city property
var unsubscribe = window.scoApi.observeEvent("identity.city", function (data) { 
    console.log("City changed to %s.", data.value); 
});

// Stop observing
unsubscribe();
```

#### setCheckoutEnabled(value) => void

Pass a false-ish value to disable the checkout. While disabled, the merchant can safely perform updates to the cart. When finished, call setCheckoutEnabled(true) to re-enable the checkout and make it reflect the changes made.
